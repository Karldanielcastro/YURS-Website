        <h2 id="header2">The pearling industry was the main source
             of income of the land. The pearling industry was the one 
             keeping this plot of land that is yet unnamed survive in
              the early ages, before it was founded and named UAE in 1971. 
              The pearling industry thrived in the 19th and early 20th centuries,
               providing income and employment to the people of the Gulf.

            Many inhabitants were semi-nomadic, pearl diving in the summer 
            and tending date gardens in the winter. But the economic depression
             of the late 1920s and early 1930s coupled with the Japanese invention
              of the cultured pearl irreparably damaged the pearling industry.</h2>

        <h2 id="AJDRH">In the early 1930s the first oil company teams conducted geological surveys in the UAE. 
            Thirty years later, in 1962, the first cargo of crude oil was exported from Abu Dhabi. With the economy
             steadily progressing, HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was chosen as the Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966. 
             Under Sheikh Zayed, the steady oil revenues resulted in an infrastructure overhaul with the construction of schools,
             housing, hospitals and roads throughout Abu Dhabi. 
             <br>
             <br>


            The oiling industry of Abu Dhabi was very successful and he persuaded the other emirates to form a union. An agreement was reached between the rulers of six of the Emirates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Umm al-Quwain, Fujairah and Ajman), and the federation to be known as the United Arab Emirates was formally established on December 2, 1971. The seventh Emirate, Ra’s al-Khaimah, acceded to the new federation the following year. Qatar and Bahrain were established as separate nations.</h2>
